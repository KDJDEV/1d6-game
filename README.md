# 1d6 game
Solution to this stats problem:
You and your opponent play a game where you each take turns rolling 1d6 (a six sided die) and add the number rolled to your own running total. The first to reach 11 wins. You get to add +1 to each of your rolls. What is the probability that you will win if you go first? Second? What is the probability you will win if you have a 30% chance of going first?

This is the final output of running the script:
```
Final probability of win for P1: 42741667/60466176 ≈ 0.7068690270739132
Final probability of win for P2: 17724509/60466176 ≈ 0.2931309729260868

Final probability of winning if you have a 30% chance of going first: 63074141/151165440 ≈ 0.4172523891704347
```
